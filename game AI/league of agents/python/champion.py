CHAMPION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This class defines a Champion in League of Legends. While a champion object
is first initialized with standardized stats, based on what champion is picked,
it retrieves all the starting stats (HP, MP, AD, etc.) from a champion data
saved in a JSON file.
